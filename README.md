# asynchronous-programming


This quick project implements the challenging programming concept of concurrency in the form of asynchronous programming.
The time module is utilised as well to better visualise the difference between the two. 
With the time function only pausing but remaining the dominant operation during the procress. 
Asynchronous I/O operates by handing over operational control to another function whilst it awaits a specific action. 
In the case of this script, the countdown will only resume as the fibonnaci sequence reaches the conclusion of the loop used to instantiate it.
